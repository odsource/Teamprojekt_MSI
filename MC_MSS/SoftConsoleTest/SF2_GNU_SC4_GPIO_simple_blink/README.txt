                   SmartFusion2 MSS GPIO simple blink example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates the use of the SmartFusion2 MSS GPIO outputs.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execute this project on a SmartFusion2 Eval Kit programmed with a design
as described in the "Target Hardware" section below. You will see LEDs toggling
on/off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example is targeted at the SmartFusion2 Development Kit. It expects MSS
GPIO 0 to MSS GPIO 3 to be configured as output and connected to LEDs 1 to 4 as
follows:
    MSS_GPIO0:  connected to LED1 using SmartFusion2 pin E1
    MSS_GPIO1:  connected to LED2 using SmartFusion2 pin F4
    MSS_GPIO2:  connected to LED3 using SmartFusion2 pin F3
    MSS_GPIO3:  connected to LED4 using SmartFusion2 pin G7

This example is built to execute on an M2S090 die. You will need to overwrite 
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with the 
one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a newer silicon
revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
