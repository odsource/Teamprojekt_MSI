                    SmartFusion2 MSS GPIO interrupt example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates the use of the SmartFusion2 MSS GPIO
interrupts.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project requires MMUART0 to be connected to a host PC. The host PC
must connect to the serial port using a terminal emulator such as HyperTerminal
or PuTTY configured as follows:
    - 57600 baud
    - 8 data bits
    - 1 stop bit
    - no parity
    - no flow control

The example project will display instructions over the serial port. Press one of
the switches on the board to generate an interrupt. The interrupt service routine
will display a message when the interrupt occurs. Each switch generates an
interrupt of a different type:
    - SW1: edge positive interrupt.
    - SW2: edge negative interrupt.
    - SW3: both edge positive and negative interrupt.
    - SW4: level low interrupt.

                                Target hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project is targeted at a SmartFusion2 Eval Kit design which
has MMUART0 enabled and connected to a host PC. The example project is built for
a design using a SmartFusion2 MSS APB clock frequency of 83MHz. Trying to
execute this example project on a different design will result in incorrect baud
rate being used by MMUART0 or no output if MMUART0 is not enabled and connected.

It also expects MSS GPIO 8 to MSS GPIO 12 to be configured as inputs connected
to switches 1 to 5 as follows:
    MSS_GPIO8:  connected to switch SW1 using SmartFusion2 pin L20
    MSS_GPIO9:  connected to switch SW2 using SmartFusion2 pin K16
    MSS_GPIO10: connected to switch SW3 using SmartFusion2 pin K18
    MSS_GPIO11: connected to switch SW4 using SmartFusion2 pin J18
    
This example project can be used with another design using a different clock
configuration. This can be achieved by overwriting the content of this example
project's "drivers_config/sys_config" folder with the one generated by Libero
as part of your design's creation.

This example is built to execute on an M2S090 die. You will need to overwrite 
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with the 
one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a newer silicon 
revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
